Graphics: SDL2

Netcode based on [Simple Network Library
from "Networking for Game Programmers" by Glenn Fiedler](http://www.gaffer.org/networking-for-game-programmers)
(author moved to other domain
and reworked his site,
so the link is now broken)

### If you're interested in history of this project, you can read our [devlog](https://regular-dev.itch.io/biplanes-revival/devlog/714967/5th-year-anniversary-update)


## Modding:

- Windows users can modify 
resources in the ```assets``` directory.

- AppImage users will have to 
download & extract [game assets](https://github.com/regular-dev/biplanes-revival/releases/download/v1.1/assets.zip) 
next to the executable, 
so the game will load resources 
from there instead. 

- Flatpak users will have to
download & extract [game assets](https://github.com/regular-dev/biplanes-revival/releases/download/v1.1/assets.zip) 
anywhere inside ```~/.var/app/org.regular_dev.biplanes_revival``` 
and run the game supplied with ***full*** path to parent directory 
of the extracted assets like so:
```flatpak run --env=BIPLANES_ASSETS_ROOT=/home/{YOUR_USERNAME}/.var/app/org.regular_dev.biplanes_revival org.regular_dev.biplanes_revival```


## Credits:

Linux port, matchmaking and AI would never come to life without [xion's](https://github.com/xxxxxion) help.
Kudos to this person!

Big thanks to [punchingdig](https://www.youtube.com/user/punchingdig) 
for his artistic help (upscaling the splash screen,
making custom soundpacks & cozy Christmas theme, redrawing some of the sprites & frames, etc.).
Not to mention countless hours of patient playtesting...

Huge thanks to [DvaMishkiLapa](https://github.com/DvaMishkiLapa) 
for bringing the game to PS Vita!


## Building:

### Ubuntu/Debian-based:

```bash
sudo apt install git g++ cmake
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/regular-dev/biplanes-revival
cd biplanes-revival
cmake .
cmake --build .
```

### Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S git gcc cmake
sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/regular-dev/biplanes-revival
cd biplanes-revival
cmake .
cmake --build .
```

### macOS (Sierra 10.12 and newer):

[macOS workflow](https://github.com/regular-dev/biplanes-revival/actions/workflows/macos-build.yml) builds fine, but we don't have any
MacBooks for runtime testing unfortunately,
so feel free to report any issues (or successes)

It's [confirmed](https://github.com/regular-dev/biplanes-revival/issues/2#issuecomment-2501199862) the game works on macOS 12.

```bash
brew install git gcc cmake
brew install jpeg-xl
brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/regular-dev/biplanes-revival
cd biplanes-revival
cmake .
cmake --build .
```

### Windows (MSVC)

You'll need to help CMake find SDL2 development libraries.
It's best to follow [MSVC workflow steps](https://github.com/regular-dev/biplanes-revival/blob/master/.github/workflows/windows-build-msvc.yml#L63-L65) for reference

### Windows (MSYS2 mingw32 environment):

```bash
sudo pacman -S git
sudo pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-gcc mingw-w64-i686-sdl2 mingw-w64-i686-sdl2_image mingw-w64-i686-sdl2_mixer
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/regular-dev/biplanes-revival
cd biplanes-revival
cmake .
cmake --build .
```

For sharing static Windows builds with other people
you should provide the following win32 releases of SDL2 as well:

- [SDL2.dll](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases)
- [SDL2_image.dll](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases)
- [SDL2_mixer.dll](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/releases)


### WebAssembly (Emscripten)

Install & activate [emsdk](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#installation-instructions-using-the-emsdk-recommended)

#### Build:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/regular-dev/biplanes-revival
emcmake cmake -S biplanes-revival -B biplanes-revival-build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
cd biplanes-revival-build
emmake make
```
Alternatively, you can use [Emscripten workflow](https://github.com/regular-dev/biplanes-revival/blob/master/.github/workflows/emscripten-build.yml#L53) steps

#### Run:
```bash
cd bin
emrun index.html
```

Until someone manages to solve [these problems](https://github.com/regular-dev/biplanes-revival/issues/4#issuecomment-2771024794), online multiplayer is cut from this version
